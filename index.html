    <p>As a security-first developer and data enthusiast with a background in infrastructure private equity and a
        passion for cloud computing, I am always seeking new opportunities to use my skills and knowledge to make a
        positive impact. With a strong foundation in Python, SQL, Excel, cybersecurity, and cloud computing, I am
        confident in my ability to contribute to software engineering, AI, cloud operations, and cloud security.</p>

    <p>I enjoy immersing myself in the horror genre and building custom gaming PCs in my free time. I am always looking
        for new and exciting horror movies, books, and games to add to my collection, and I find great satisfaction in
        piecing together custom gaming systems. Building PCs allows me to combine my technical skills with my passion
        for gaming, and I enjoy researching and selecting the best components for each build.</p>

    <p>I am excited to connect with others in the cloud computing and data analytics communities and explore new
        opportunities to grow and learn. Let's <a href="contact.html">connect!</a></p>

    <p>Skills/Tools: Data Cleansing, Database Management, Data Analysis, Data Visualization, Excel, Python (Pandas,
        NumPy,), SQL, Cloud engineering, Cloud development/deployment, Cloud operations, Cloud Security, SIEM, Splunk
